			<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,</p>
			<p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, </p>
			<p>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, </p>
			<p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. </p>
			<p>`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door - </p>
			<p>Only this, and nothing more.' </p>
		</div>

		<div class="verse">
			<p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, </p>
			<p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. </p>
			<p>Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
			<p>From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -</p>
			<p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -</p>
			<p>Nameless here for evermore.</p>
